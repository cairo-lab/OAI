# OAI

This repo is a collection of scripts for navigating and making sense of the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset. With over 9,000 variables tracked for almost 5,000 patients, this project is a medical goldmine.  It also less than trivial to get a sense of where to start.  The scripts in this repo are an attempt to help.
